    <p> <img src="img/Hair by Stef.png" alt="stock photos"> Hi there! My name is Diana Stefenyuk and I help people confidently take on the world. Whether it be styling and cutting hair to doing lash extensions. I will have you feeling your best for any type of event. They say practice makes perfect so when I'm not experimenting with cool looks, I attend Gene Juarez Academy to learn more about the beauty of the world. I am going to graduate this September. I will then be able to put my practice into work. When I'm not studying or styling hair, you can find me at a local coffee shop enjoying all the new flavors of coffee and spending time wiht my friends. I can't wait to see you! </p>
